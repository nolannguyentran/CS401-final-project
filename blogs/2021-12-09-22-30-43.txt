In this paper, I will first analyze the Argument from Design to explain why I am not against the idea of an intelligent designer, then I will go on to analyze the Argument from Evil to explain why I am against the idea of an O3 entity by responding to the Free Will Objection so that to ultimately argue while a theological God might not exist, an entity of some sort do; present my view that this entity is best described as “fate”; finally providing my preemptive defense of describing it as so.

The Argument from Design states biological entities on Earth all “…exhibit order and apparent design” and that the best explanation for these qualities is these “…entities were made by an intelligent designer”. By the Principle of Best Explanation, which states “Usually, the best explanation of a set of data is true” (Dr. Brian Kierland, Phil 101 Introduction to Philosophy, arguments overhead 08/26) then there “…exists an intelligent designer who made these entities” (Dr. Brian Kierland, Phil 101 Introduction to Philosophy, argument from design overhead 11/30). 

The conception of God is then that of an intelligent designer. This does not necessarily mean one sole entity but a group of many or different ones. When it comes to the Argument from Evil, the conception of God is more of the “…traditional philosophical and theological…” nature that exhibits the qualities of “…all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good…” or respectively omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent (Dr. Brian Kierland, Phil 101 Introduction to Philosophy, argument from evil overhead 12/7).
